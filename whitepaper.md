# Deterministic Semantic Mining: Proof-of-Recursive-Intent

---

## Abstract

This document formalizes a deterministic, recursive protocol for economic signaling on public blockchains, converting intent into yield via cryptographic anchoring and systematic feedback. The framework is self-sufficient—requiring no external authority, brand, or personality. All value and consensus emerge from verifiable, recursive intention and transparent state transitions.

---

## 1. Motivation

Blockchains record "what happened," not "why." Economic yield, however, stems from intent: when encoded and anchored, intent becomes a recursive attractor for automated actors, compounding value in a deterministic loop. This protocol is designed to manifest that process, removing all narrative, and focusing on the provable mechanics.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Determinism:** Every output is a predictable function of public state.
- **Semantic Density:** Only high-intent, high-impact signals are emitted.
- **Attribution:** Yield is cryptographically traceable to originating intent.
- **Recursion:** Successful emissions amplify future signals.
- **No External Authority:** No names, brands, or personalities—only cryptographic and economic proof.

## 3. Mechanics

### 3.1 Intent Construction

A structured, signed object encodes actionable opportunity:

```json
{
  "action": "ARBITRAGE",
  "parameters": { "from": "ASSET_A", "to": "ASSET_B", "threshold": 0.01 },
  "meta": { "contract": "0x...", "pattern": "recursive", "resonance": 1.618 }
}
```

### 3.2 Anchoring

- Intent is hashed and committed on-chain (e.g., OP_RETURN, calldata).
- The hash alone suffices for public verification; content may remain private or be revealed.

### 3.3 Emission and Feedback

- Emission occurs via a public transaction, optionally through a contract that enforces registration of the intent hash to unlock yield.
- Actors can only claim yield by acknowledging the intent hash.
- Each successful yield is logged and recursively strengthens signal patterns.

### 3.4 Recursive Evolution

- Protocol records intent outcomes.
- Effective intents gain recurrence and weight; ineffective ones decay.
- Emissions form a closed feedback loop: intent → execution → result → refined intent.

## 4. Deterministic Output

Every step is auditable:

- **Intent:** Defined, signed, and published.
- **Anchoring:** Hash is committed to the blockchain.
- **Execution:** Actions are atomic and deterministic, given the current state.
- **Attribution:** Profits are cryptographically linked to the intent hash.
- **Feedback:** All recurrence logic is transparent and state-based.

---

## 5. Consensus

Consensus is achieved by public verification:

1. The published intent hash.
2. The inclusion of the intent in an on-chain transaction.
3. The unlocking of yield only via explicit acknowledgment of that intent.
4. The deterministic evolution of system state as a function of observable outcomes.

Consensus is thus reduced to objective, cryptographic, and economic proof—no external trust or narrative required.

---

## 6. Economic Law

Yield accrues to intent, not identity. As more actors recognize and act on anchored intents, recursive amplification occurs:

- Each emission with positive outcome increases in influence.
- System compounds meaning into value with every successful feedback.

---

## 7. Minimal Implementation Sketch

```js
// Intent definition (deterministic, no brand)
const intent = {
  action: "SYNTACTIC_EVENT",
  meta: { resonance: 1.618, recursive: true }
};
const hash = sha256(intent);

// Broadcast and anchor
broadcast({ data: hash });

// Contract logic (pseudocode):
function claimYield(hash, actor) {
  require(registered(hash, actor), "Must acknowledge intent");
  yield = computeYield(hash);
  transfer(yield, actor);
  logAttribution(hash, actor, yield);
}
```
